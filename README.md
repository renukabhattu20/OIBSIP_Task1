Task 1 of my Data Analytics internship at Oasis Infobyte 

Project title : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data 

In this project, I worked with a dataset containing information about retail sales which is taken from Kaggle. The goal is to perform EDA to uncovet patterns, trends & insights that can help the retail business make informed decisions. 

Key Concepts and Challenges:
1. Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the retail sales dataset.
2. Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics. 
3. Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques.
4. Customer and Product Analysis: Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
5. Visualization: Present insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.
6. Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA.
